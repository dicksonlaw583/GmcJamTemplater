# GMC Jam Templater

Easy custom formatting for GMC Jam review posts

## Requirements

- GMS 2.2.5
- GMC Jam Player (ships with every all-in-one Jam zip)

## Download

Simply clone or download this repository, and open the `GmcJamTemplater.yyp` file.

Alternatively, you can also go to the [releases page](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/GmcJamTemplater/releases) and download a pre-built program to run. *Note that you would not be able to customize the processing hook scripts this way.*

## How to Use

1. (Optional) Customize `template.txt` and the processing hook scripts under the `GmcJamTemplater_config` group to suit the way you rate entries. Further details are available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/GmcJamTemplater/wiki).
2. After you are done rating and ranking everything, just run the templater program and load the `jamdata.json` next to the main GMC Jam Player program. The program will render the template to your clipboard and exit automatically.
